# Bluetooth Enabled Door Lock

Captstone Design Project for CME 495.

Arduino based device used to create a front door lock that can be locked/unlocked using a smartphone and bluetooth serial communication.    

This project taught us the basics of using bluetooth in hardware based projects, and the importance of regularly scheduled meetings to stay on top of things throughout the project.     

There are two major next steps for this project if it was to continue:
- Creating a dedicated smartphone application capable of:
  - Changing passwords
  - Managing multiple locking devices
  - Encrypting password attempts before sending them through bluetooth.     
- Spending more time on the security of the information used, specifically storing the password using encryption.     

This project used:
- Arduino Nano
- Bluetooth transmitter
- Motor
- H-bridge
- Locking hardware
